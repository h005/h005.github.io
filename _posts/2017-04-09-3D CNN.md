In this blog, I would make a summary of 3D shape retrieval.

In almost all state of the art approaches, sketch based 3D shape retrieval amounts to finding the "best views" for 3D models and hand-crafting the right features for matching sketches and views.

&ensp;&ensp;This paper drastically reduce the number of views to noly two predefined directions for the whole dataset, assuming that the **majority of models are upright**. Then learn two Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), one for the views and one for the sketches.

&ensp;&ensp;The upright assumption appears to be strong, but it turns out to be sensible for 3D datasets.

**Contributions**

> - They propose to learn feature representations for sketch based shape retrieval, which bypass the dilemma of best view selection;
> - They adopt two Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks to successfully learn similarities in both the within-domain and the cross domain.
> - They outputform all the state of the art methods on three large datasets significantly.

In this paper, the authors propose a multi-level 3D shape feature extraction framework by using deep learning.
